# Emotion Detection using Transfer Learning

This repository contains code for emotion detection using transfer learning with the ResNet model and a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Introduction

Emotion detection is a critical task in various domains such as human-computer interaction, marketing, and healthcare. This project explores the use of transfer learning with the ResNet architecture and a custom CNN to accurately classify emotions from facial images.

## Models

### 1. Transfer Learning with ResNet

Transfer learning is employed by leveraging a pre-trained ResNet model, which has been trained on the ImageNet dataset. The ResNet model is fine-tuned on our emotion detection dataset to adapt it for our specific task.

### 2. Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A custom CNN model is trained from scratch using a specific architecture designed for emotion detection. It learns hierarchical features directly from pixel intensities of facial images.

## IPython Notebooks

The code for training and evaluating the models is provided in two IPython Notebooks:

- [Emotion_Detection_transfer_learning.ipynb](Emotion_Detection_transfer_learning.ipynb) for the Transfer Learning with ResNet model.
- [Emotion_Detection.ipynb](Emotion_Detection.ipynb) for the Custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

You can open and run these notebooks in your preferred Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Dataset

We use a publicly available dataset consisting of labeled facial images expressing various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- OpenCV (for image processing)

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
